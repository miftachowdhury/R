This program analyzes data on opioid-related deaths in New York State between 2003 and 2017. The final product is a function that allows a user to enter the name of a NYS county and two years within the available range, and returns:
1) Opioid-related death rates for each of those two years in that county and in New York State.
3) For each of the two years, the percentage of the total statewide opioid-related deaths accounted for by the county. 
3) For each of the two years, the percentage of the total statewide population accounted for by the county.
4) The percent change in opioid-related death rate between the two years, for both the county and New York State.
